I have used localstorage to save date and also used redux for state management. Used ref for implementing download resume using react-pdf plugin. used redux forms to manage forms and create components from autocomplete and bootstrap for supporting in redux forms. Implemented Navbar as decorator and used in necessary files. I have used create react app which does not support experimental features so I had to make some changes for making decorators work in this.
